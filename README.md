## drugstore_solidity ##
Simple drugstore solidity based contract

*The intention of this contract is to create a basic understanding of the basic structure.*

✔️ :heavy_check_mark: Line 6 creates a mechanism to count drugs. It is implemented in line 37.

✔️ :heavy_check_mark: Line 8 is a key/value based structure allowing to access struct Drugstore (structure of elements. e.g. manufacturer, drug name etc.).

✔️ :heavy_check_mark: Line 12 implements opening time (Epoch time is used).

✔️ :heavy_check_mark: Lines  14, 19 adds modifiers (adding condition prior to function execution).

✔️ :heavy_check_mark: Line 29 is executed only once, as soon as contract has been lauched.

✔️ :heavy_check_mark: Line 33 allows adding drugs, increments count and refers every newly added item to the counter.(e.g. once new item is added, the counter will increment by 1).
